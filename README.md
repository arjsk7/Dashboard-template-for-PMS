📊 Employee Performance Management Dashboard (PMS Template)

A clean and simple Power BI dashboard suite built as a mock Performance Management System.
The project includes three views that reflect how different roles inside a company would consume performance data:

Executive Dashboard – company-level performance overview

Manager Dashboard – team-level insights and comparisons

Employee Dashboard – personal performance summary

This is a template, not a production system. The dataset is fully mocked, but structured to resemble the kind of metrics HR/Operations teams actually use.

🗂️ About the Mock Data

The dataset contains one month of daily records (October 2025) for four employees.
Each row represents a single day of work and includes:

Tasks Assigned & Completed

Errors

SLA Achieved or Breached

Presence & Late Status

Hours Worked

Productivity %

Quality %

SLA Compliance %

Attendance %

Weighted Performance Score

All values were generated manually/algorithmically to look realistic, so the dashboards behave like they’re plugged into an actual PMS tool.

📌 What the Dashboards Show
⭐ Executive View

High-level KPIs, weekly SLA trends, department performance comparison, and a consolidated employee table.

⭐ Manager View

Manager-wise team performance, SLA gauge, quality/productivity weekly trends, and a comparison of team member performance scores.

⭐ Employee View

A personal scorecard that shows productivity trends, SLA trends (if added), performance score gauge, total work summary, and a daily breakdown table.

Each page maintains a clean layout, consistent theming, and readable visuals to mimic an internal analytics product.

🧮 Key KPIs & Measures

The dashboards use simple DAX measures to calculate:

Productivity %

Quality %

SLA Compliance %

Attendance %

Performance Score (weighted metric)

Total Tasks

Errors

Late Days

Everything updates dynamically based on slicer selections.

🎯 Why This Exists

This project isn’t about perfect data — it’s a demonstration of how to structure a multi-level BI reporting system for employee performance.
